Overview
--------

Ketcher is an open-source web-based chemical structure editor. Ketcher is designed for chemists, laboratory scientists and technicians who draw structures and reactions.

Ketcher is developed using pure JavaScript and incorporates high performance, good portability and light weight. You will not need any Java or Flash plugins to use it in your browser. 

Ketcher is completely free and open-source, while also available on a commercial basis.

You can easily integrate Ketcher into your web application. Ketcher is actively developed and improved by the dedicated team.

Other products and 3-rd party code
----------------------------------

Ketcher uses `Indigo Service <https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/service/index.html>`__ for computationally intensive procedures.

Ketcher leverages `Raphael <http://raphaeljs.com/>`_ framework to support objects rendering and representation on the canvas.

Standalone and Remote modes
---------------------------

Ketcher is provided in 2 modes: *Standalone* and *Remote*. 

The *Standalone* mode incorporates Indigo backend services in the Ketcher build. It allows for Ketcher to work in browser with no server and even without the Internet connection. In this mode the pictures recognition provided by Indigo service is not available. 

The *Remote* mode requires Indigo server deployed and connected. It will provide all the Ketcher abilities leveraging Indigo. 

Main features
-------------

**Fast and convenient editing.** We strive to make Ketcher as easy to use and as fast as the state-of-the-art desktop structure editing tools. Here are some highlights:

- Lasso and Rectangle selection tools, plus a special Fragment selection tool to deal with connected components, rather than single atoms/bonds.
- A variety of `hotkeys <https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/editing-tips.html#hotkeys>`_
- Undo/Redo.
- Copy/Paste for the canvas objects

**Atoms & Bonds**. Ketcher supports basic properties and query features, adding aliases and Generic group usage.

**Stereochemistry.** Ketcher provides complete stereochemistry support during the editing, loading, and saving of chemical structures.

**Reactions.** Full-featured reaction support including reacting centers, atom flags and AAM.

**S-groups.** All major S-group types are supported including generic, SRU polymers, multiple groups, superatoms and data S-groups.

**R-groups.** R-site and R-fragment assignment is supported, as well as attachment point specification and R-logic.

**Template library** (including custom and user's templates) & Functional groups support
