# Ketcher 3.0.0

## What's Changed
üéâ  We‚Äôre excited to introduce Ketcher 3.0, featuring the newly available Macromolecules mode!

This mode enables users to work with monomers and RNA presets, combine them into polymer chains, create antisense chains, import/export of different formats (HELM, SCSR/MOL V3000, Sequence, FASTA, IDT, Ket). More information provided in [User manual for Macromolecules mode](https://github.com/epam/ketcher?tab=readme-ov-file#macromolecules-mode)

Along with this major enhancement, we've included various improvements and bug fixes to enhance performance and usability.

Here are the updated release notes with links to the corresponding issues:
