New portal for Indigo and other Life Sciences Open Source products 
------------------------------------------------------------------


There was a long silence period. EPAM Systems acquired GGA, in order to strengthen Life Science & Healthcare vertical. And now we proud to announce that we are continuing to undertake the Open Source initiative through EPAM.

We are glad to present the new portal for the Life Sciences Open-Source products.

http://lifescience.opensource.epam.com

At the moment portal contains only documentation and downloads. We were working hard to create the Open-Source projects documentation fully based on Sphinx system. And we have great plans how to improve the portal to make more convenient and functional in the nearest future. Our first goal is to keep all the existing content accessible. There will be some time for migrating sources it into the new environment.

We will continue to develop the cheminformatics tools and utilities. Also we have prepared some new cool features for the next coming releases.

Thank you for your support and participation.  We are looking forward to continue collaboration and to receive any suggestions or feedback.
