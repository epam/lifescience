KNIME Nodes

We provide a number of freely available `nodes <knime.html>`__ for the
`KNIME <http://knime.org>`__ workflow engine. The nodes are based on
Indigo and its Java SDK.

Java GUI Utilities
------------------

Two Indigo-based Java GUI applications are provided:

-  `Legio <legio.html>`__ — combinatorial chemistry
-  `ChemDiff <chemdiff.html>`__ — visual comparison of two SDF or SMILES
   files

Command-Line Utilities
----------------------

Three Indigo-based command-line utilities written in plain C are
provided:

-  `indigo-depict <indigo-depict.html>`__ (former ``dingo-render``)
   Molecule and reaction rendering utility.
-  `indigo-cano <indigo-cano.html>`__ (former ``cano-utility``)
   Canonical SMILES generator.
-  `indigo-deco <indigo-deco.html>`__ (former ``deco``) R-Group
