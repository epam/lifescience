Nodes for KNIME
===============

Since May 2011, our team provides Indigo-powered
cheminformatics nodes nodes for KNIME. The overview of the nodes is
available at `KNIME Tech <http://tech.knime.org/community/indigo>`__.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you need to add the `KNIME update
site <http://www.knime.org/update/2.3/>`__ into your "software sites"
list, if it is not already there
(`instructions <http://www.knime.org/downloads/update>`__). From that
site, you need to download the *Base Chemistry Types & Nodes* (needed
for the Indigo nodes to work) and the *Distance Matrix* (needed for one
of the provided Indigo examples to work).

You need to add the KNIME's `Community Contributions Nightly
Updates <http://tech.knime.org/update/community-contributions/nightly>`__
site to tour "software sites" list
(`instructions <http://tech.knime.org/community-contributions-info>`__).
Then, you need to download the "Indigo KNIME Integration" package.

"Unsigned Content" warning during the installation is OK, you can safely
ignore it.

After you successfully install the Indigo nodes and restart Eclipse, you
should be able to see the new nodes in the "Community Nodes/Indigo"
section. Also, some example workflows are available in
099\_Community/07\_Indigo directory of the KNIME Example Flow Server.
