   -  Try the `NGB demo <http://ngb.opensource.epam.com/catgenome>`__: Analize genome online

Cheminformatics
---------------

-  `Bingo <bingo/index.html>`__ Chemistry search engine for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases |image1|

   -  Bingo is a RDBMS data cartridge that provides the industry's
      next-generation, fast, scalable, and efficient storage and searching
      solution for chemical information.
   -  Bingo seamlessly integrates the chemistry into Oracle, Microsoft SQL
      Server and PostgreSQL databases. Its extensible indexing is designed to
      enable scientists to store, index, and search chemical moieties
      alongside numbers and text within one underlying relational database
      server

-  `Ketcher <ketcher/index.html>`__ Web-based molecule sketcher |image2|

   -  Ketcher is a web-based chemical structure editor.
   -  Since Ketcher is written in pure Javascript, it incorporates high
      performance, good portability and light weight. You will not need any
      Java or Flash plugins to use it in your browser. Ketcher is completely
      free and open-source, while also available on a commercial basis.
   -  `Ketcher 2.0 demo <ketcher/demo.html>`__: Edit molecules online

-  `Indigo Toolkit <indigo/index.html>`__ Universal cheminformatics
   toolkit and API |image3|

   -  Indigo is a universal organic chemistry toolkit. It contains first-class
      tools for end users, as well as a documented `API <indigo/api/index.html>`__
      for developers. Indigo it is completely free and open-source, while also
      available on a commercial basis.
   -  Indigo-based command-line `utilities <indigo/index.html#command-line-utilities>`__
   -  Number of freely available cheminformatics `KNIME nodes <indigo/knime.html>`__
   -  Indigo-based `Java GUI applications <indigo/index.html#java-gui-utilities>`__

-  `Indigo ELN <indigo/eln/index.html>`__ Open-Source Chemistry Electronic Lab Notebook |image4|

   -  Indigo ELN allows scientists to prepare, plan,manage and access relevant 
      information regarding research work. Application  helps to analyze and share 
      research information. Flexiable experiment template allows to support various 
      experiment type. New components can be included in the application without 
      the need to change the core code.

   -  Indigo ELN v 2.0 is the next version of EPAM open-source Indigo ELN based 
      on a completely different technology stack than v.1.0 and providing a new 
      interface, new features, at the same time retaining all the functionality 
      previously implemented.




-  `Imago OCR <imago/index.html>`__ Chemical optical recognition toolkit |image5|

   -  Imago OCR is a toolkit for 2D chemical structure image recognition. It
      contains a `GUI <imago/imago-gui.html>`__ program and a `command-line
      utility <imago/imago_console.html>`__, as well as a documented
